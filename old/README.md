# My Code, Github's Website.
> My website which is run under github's subdomain. 
> I prefer the `.github.io` domain than nelifty's `.neltlify.app`.
> Netlify doesn't let me edit directly unless when I delete the index file. 
> P.S This is the 5th or 7th time i've tried to deploy on github. My account was flagged so I asked for it to NOT be flagged.
